# stock-analysis
using VBA to conduct stock analysis

•	Overview of Project: The Stakeholders are interested in the results of thousands of stocks in 2017 and 2018 using VBA and excel. 

•	Results: 
The first line of code for comparing the results from 2017 and 2018 ran slower than the second line of code. 
These are the execution times for the first line of code in 2017 and 2018:

These are the execution times for the second line of code in 2017 and 2018:

The second analysis is faster. 
The difference in time for 2017 is:
0.82398438-0.1132813 X 100% = 72% improvement

The difference in time for 2018 is:
0.8359375-0.1015625 X 100% = 73% improvement


The dataset only has data for two years. If stakeholders wanted to make predictions more data is probably necesary to make more accurate predictions. 


•	Summary:

The advantages at refactoring code is that the analysis is quicker and the stackholder will be happier with quicker results.
